# Diabetes-Feature-Engineering

## Business Problem

It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified. We are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.

## Dataset

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.
